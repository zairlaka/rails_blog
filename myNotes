**best practice before adding any gem make a git 
rails 

git

create a controller 

create

after 12 min 

#rake routes 
show the all routes
#rails g model Post title:string body:text
it will create a migrate file in db/migrate folder
to migrate 
#rails db:migrate

if you do something wrong or make a mistake you run this command below
#rails db:rollback 

add simple_form in gem
#bundle install
then 
#rails generate simple_form:install --bootstrap
after that copy 
= simple_form_for(@user, html: { class: 'form-inline' }) do |form|
this line and add into your from file simple
